# Problem 0

# Problem 1
# Write a function that takes a list of non-negative integer
# values and returns a string of a bar graph representation of the list.
# The length of each bar should be the same as the value at that index.
# That means if g[0] = 9, then the first bar should have a length of 9.

# 6: =========

# Problem 5

# Write a function that keeps track of the frequencies of values
# from a list containing only integers.
# For example, if the provided list only contained 0s and 1s,
# and there were 8 0s and 23 1s, then the fucntion should
# return this list: [8, 23]
# It is important to understand that each index in the new
# list represents a value from the parameter list. So the new
# list needs to be as large as the biggest value in the parameter.

# Problem 6
# If you use bar_graph on a list with sufficiently large
# values, you'll have a problem with the bars taking up
# more than one line.

# Write a new bar_graph function that will draw a scaled bar
# graph. It should take an argument for the scale factor,
# such that 1 piece of a bar represents 1 quantity equal
# to the scale factor.

# Problem 7

# random.randrange() distributes numbers evenly, meaning
# that every possible random value has an equal chance
# of being returned.

# How could you test how evenly random.randrange()
# distributes the results?

# Write code below that performs the test you described.

#==================================================
# Problem 8

# There is a different way of getting random numbers
# random.normalvariate(m, s) returns a random floating point
# value using what is called a "normal distribution".

# The function below will generate a list of n integers
# using a normal distribution that will have a mean
# value of m
def normal_rand_list(n, m):
    g = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        g.append( int(random.normalvariate(m, 1)) )
        i+= 1
    return g

# This is an example of using normal_rand_list
# Feel free to look at its values
normal_list = normal_rand_list(10, 5)


# Use a similar process as you did in problem 7
# to try and figure out what the differece is between
# the normal distribution and the distribution of random.randrange
# YOUR CODE HERE


# Describe the difference between the two distributions below.
# Cite the evidence from your tests
